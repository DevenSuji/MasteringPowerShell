If/elseif/else block:
    Only the script block of the first expression that is True will run. None of the other blocks will run one a true condition is encountered and that particular block is executed.

Switch:
    Will run all the script block where the condition meets. SO if multiple conditions meet then multiple script blocks will execute.
